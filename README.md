Hey. I am TheP1geon. It might not seem like it, but I am probably one of the best programmers you will meet. Not *the* best, but one of the best. Yeah, that's about it. I like C and Zig. I don't fancy programming in Rust, but I think it's a fine language to write applictions in; just don't shove it down my throat and we're good.

I am currently writing a compiler for my language, Nomi. You can find the source code here too. The eventual plan is to write an operating system and toolchain with Nomi, but that's a later problem to solve.
